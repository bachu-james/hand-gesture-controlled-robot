# 🤖 Hand Gesture Controlled Robot using OpenCV, MediaPipe & ESP32

This project demonstrates a **real-time hand gesture controlled robot car**
using **computer vision** and **wireless communication**.

Hand gestures are detected using **OpenCV + MediaPipe** on a PC,
and control commands are sent via **UDP over Wi-Fi** to an **ESP32**,
which drives the motors through a motor driver.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition
- Wireless control using Wi-Fi (UDP protocol)
- Low-latency command transmission
- ESP32-based motor control
- Modular architecture (PC + Embedded system)
- Easy to extend for ROS 2 or ESP32-CAM
